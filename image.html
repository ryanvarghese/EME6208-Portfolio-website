        <p>The completion of this project involved a meticulous blend of creativity, technical skill, and thoughtful design. The first task focused on creating a poster inspired by Fight Club. This required understanding the essence of the narrative and translating its themes into visual elements. Central to the design was the split-face image of Tyler Durden and the Narrator, symbolizing the duality of identity—a core theme of the book. The process began with sourcing high-quality images and editing them to achieve a seamless blend, ensuring that the split-face effect was striking yet cohesive.
            To further reinforce the thematic connection, a pink soap bar featuring the title “FIGHT CLUB” was positioned prominently at the center, serving as an iconic symbol from the story. The background, layered with falling money, was carefully edited to critique consumerism and material wealth, echoing the book's anti-materialist ethos. Adjusting the lighting, color balance, and transparency of each layer was crucial to achieving a visually dynamic composition that was both engaging and symbolic.
            The second task involved designing a logo for a cosmetics brand, True Beauty. The process began with brainstorming concepts that embodied natural beauty, inclusivity, and eco-consciousness. A green bottle was chosen as the centerpiece, representing the brand’s chemical-free philosophy. The heart on top of the bottle symbolized purity and care, while the sunflower, emerging from the bottle, celebrated positivity and vitality. Each petal was designed in a different skin tone to highlight inclusivity and diversity. The combination of these elements required precise vector illustration and color grading to ensure visual harmony and an impactful message.
            Finally, both projects demanded attention to detail, creativity, and alignment with their respective themes. Iterative feedback and refinements were integral to achieving polished outcomes, making the designs not just aesthetically pleasing but also deeply meaningful.
