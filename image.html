                <p class="description">This design features a striking split-face image of Tyler Durden and the Narrator, symbolizing the duality of their identities. The cover prominently displays a pink soap bar at the center, emblazoned with the title "FIGHT CLUB," which echoes the iconic imagery from the story. Surrounding this central element is a background of falling money, representing the critique of consumerism and material wealth that permeates the narrative. The careful layering of these elements creates a dynamic composition that draws viewers in while reflecting the book's deeper themes of identity and rebellion.</p>

                <img src="logo.jpg" alt="Edited Image 2">This logo embodies the brand's commitment to natural beauty and inclusivity. At its core is a green bottle, symbolizing the brand’s focus on chemical-free ingredients, topped with a heart that represents purity and care for every individual. Emerging from the bottle is a sunflower, chosen for its universal symbolism of positivity and vitality. The petals of the sunflower are depicted in various skin tones, celebrating diversity and reinforcing the brand's message that beauty comes in all forms. This thoughtful combination of imagery not only highlights the brand’s eco-conscious values but also emphasizes inclusivity in beauty standards.</p>
