            <p>Welcome to my digital portfolio!
				As a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Florida, I'm excited to share some of the projects I've worked on during my "EME 6208-Designing Integrated Media Environment" course. This portfolio showcases my efforts in various aspects of digital media creation, from image editing and web design to video production and animation.
				My journey in technology began with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science in India, and now continues as I expand my skills here in Florida. Through these projects, I hope to demonstrate not only my technical abilities but also my creativity.
				I invite you to explore my work and see how I'm learning to blend technology with creativity. Whether you're a fellow student, a potential employer, or just curious about digital media, I hope you find something interesting here.
				Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio.
