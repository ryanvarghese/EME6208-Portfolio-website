            <h2>Project Video and Reflection</h2>
            <p>Creating this animation project was a rewarding experience, as it allowed me to demonstrate a scientific principle in a visual and engaging way. The use of Adobe Animate enabled me to explore the mechanics of motion tweening, rotations, and vector graphics. Initially, aligning the arrows with the car's motion and ensuring the forces were accurately represented posed some challenges. The software's interface was also somewhat complex for a beginner, particularly in synchronizing movements and adding various effects. From an educational standpoint, this project was valuable as it required me to think critically about how to convey scientific principles effectively. The visual representation of forces on the car provides viewers with an intuitive understanding of how resistance and applied forces influence a vehicle's motion.</p>
